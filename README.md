# Turbo Telegram Snake Game

A classic Snake game implementation that runs purely in the browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About

This is a simple, browser-based version of the classic Snake game. Control the snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and yourself.

```

That's it. The game runs entirely in the browser with no build step.

## How to Play
